    * 4x M5 x 16mm - Rack Rails
    * 8x M2.5 x 10mm - Rack Enclosure

### Optional

* 4x M4 x 16mm - Per 1u Rack Mount Mounting Hardware



## STLs (3D Printing)

## Directions

* Cut: 
    * 2x Sides (either with handles or without)
    * 2x Top/Bottom
    * 1x Back

* Build:
    * It's easier to mount the fan and rack rails while the enclosure is disassembled.
    * Add a rack rail to each side panel and bolt them in.
    * Pre thread nuts onto the M2.5 bolts.
    * As you piece the material together, place the threaded M2.5 bolts into the openings on the sides, back, and tops of the panels.
    * Hold the nut as you tighten the bolt in place.
